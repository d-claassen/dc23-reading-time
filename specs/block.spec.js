const LONG_STORY = `
    Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live 
the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large 
language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary
regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic
life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for
the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t
listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the
way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on
the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline
of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she
continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that
where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left
from its origin would be the word "and".
